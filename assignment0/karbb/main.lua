GD50 2018
Pong Remake

-- Main Program --

Author: Colton Ogden
cogden@cs50.harvard.edu

Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on
modern systems.

-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic

Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
out its bottom corner, for example. In this case, we only need to worry
about calling out to `push` to handle the resizing. Takes in a `w` and
`h` variable representing width and height, respectively.

Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our
game to perform consistently across all hardware; otherwise, any
changes we make will be applied as fast as possible and will vary
across system hardware.
